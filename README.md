## Hello, I am Dan Murphy!

A first-generation Computer Science graduate student from the University of California, Riverside. As a life-long learner, the constant evolution of technology excites yet scares me but will occur nonetheless. This drives me to make an impact on the world by working for a company that holds my passion of revolutionizing technology to better our daily lives.
